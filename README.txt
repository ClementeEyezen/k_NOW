The [k]NOW project is an attempt to create an AI that can infer and know information about
  my day to day life and provide information that I want to know now, before I think about
  needing it.

For instance, there have been times where I may have walked into a class or meeting and 
  wanted a file that may have been available on a cloud storage service, or even trickier, 
  on the computer at my desk that was not available online.
  Maybe I have the file, but I just want it to be ready and available, without having to go
  searching for it.
  Another similar example is if I have been taking notes on Evernote for instance, and I want
  to access a note, but instead of searching for it, wouldn't it be nice for it to predict
  which notes are most important and provides links/previews of relavant information?

The goal of [k]NOW is to develop an application that learns about the person using it, so that
  it can provide this type of thinking ahead service. I've decided that Google Now is too slow,
  I would like to do one better. This is the project that will do that.
